# Taxes Calculator
Hiring process test to calculate withheld taxes. This small project was developed in Visual Studio 2015, with a blank Asp.net 5 template. I used AngularJs, Bootstrap, Gulp and Bower.

## Login
Login credentials were mocked in login method. There are two users:<br>
- user: admin		pass: 123<br>
- user: company	pass: 123

## Mocks
- The invoices are saved in localStorage
- The autentication is persisted in sessionStorage

## Bugs
- When an invoice is saved in the history, it doesn't appear in datetime order

## Unit tests
I wrote some unit tests in /tests folder<br>
